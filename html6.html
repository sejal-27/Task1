            <h1 id="a1">MURPHY'S LAW</h1>
            <P style="padding-left: 60; text-align: justify; padding-right: 30px;">Murphy's Law is based on this. “Anything that can go wrong will go wrong,”. It also states that if there are two or more ways to do anything and one of them potentially result in disaster, someone will do it.


                But the expression that most conveys the explosive nature of Murphy's Law is without a doubt the notion that no matter what you do, you will invariably make the incorrect choice, and it may just be right.
                
                
                On the other hand, we can use Murphy's Law in our daily lives. Makes little fuss when things go well. Finally, we expect things to go our way. But when things go wrong, we look for a reason. It's something to think about, but there is no evidence to back up Murphy's Law itself. It's all about how people see it. The Law catches our attention.
                
                
                Have you ever had one of those days before? You wake up and fall out of bed while you're bundled up in the sheets. On your way to the shower, you're going over your skateboard and then you're going to stick your toe to the door jamb.
                
                
                As soon as you get your hair lathered with a shampoo, all the hot water is running out. As you come out of the shivering tub, you remember you forgot to take a towel. Can you get any worse this morning? It seems that anything that could go wrong this morning has actually gone wrong. Whether you've ever had a day like this, you 're probably already acquainted with Murphy's Law. Murphy's Law is the language that means that if anything can go wrong, it will. Is there any truth to this, though? And who's that Murphy anyway?
                
                
                The idea at the heart of Murphy's Law reflects the basic pessimism of life that many people point to and find comfort in when things just don't go their way. The concept is also broadened. Variations of Murphy's Law have been around for several years and come under several different titles, like Sod 's Rule, Finagle 's Law, the Fourth Thermodynamics Law, Newton 's Fourth Motion Law, and the Inverse Midas Contact. Most of them were in use long before the word Murphy's Law became common.
                
                
                In fact, Murphy's Law is generally credited to Captain Edward A. Murphy, Jr. Captain Murphy was an air force engineer who took part in a deceleration test at Edwards Air Force Base in California in 1949. During the check, Captain Murphy discovered that all 16 deceleration sensors had been improperly mounted. Each sensor could be mounted in two ways, and the sensor was incorrectly mounted in either case. Basically, if anything could go wrong, that's what it did. Murphy said something to that effect, others echoed it, and the theory has since become more widely known as Murphy's Law.
                
                
                In our universe, according to the Law of entropy, systems naturally tend to end up in disorder.
                
                
                Although this might be valid on a wide scale over time, it certainly doesn't justify why you tripped over your skateboard or ran out of hot water in the shower! </P>

            <h1 id="a2">BIG BANG THEORY</h1>
            <p style="padding-left: 60; text-align:justify;text-align: justify; padding-right: 30px;">The Big Bang event is a physical theory that describes how the universe expanded from an initial state of high density and temperature.Various cosmological models of the Big Bang explain the evolution of the observable universe from the earliest known periods through its subsequent large-scale form.These models offer a comprehensive explanation for a broad range of observed phenomena, including the abundance of light elements, the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation, and large-scale structure. The overall uniformity of the Universe, known as the flatness problem, is explained through cosmic inflation: a sudden and very rapid expansion of space during the earliest moments. However, physics currently lacks a widely accepted theory of quantum gravity that can successfully model the earliest conditions of the Big Bang.

                Crucially, these models are compatible with the Hubble–Lemaître law—the observation that the farther away a galaxy is, the faster it is moving away from Earth. Extrapolating this cosmic expansion backwards in time using the known laws of physics, the models describe an increasingly concentrated cosmos preceded by a singularity in which space and time lose meaning (typically named "the Big Bang singularity").In 1964 the CMB was discovered, which convinced many cosmologists that the competing steady-state model of cosmic evolution was falsified,[6] since the Big Bang models predict a uniform background radiation caused by high temperatures and densities in the distant past. A wide range of empirical evidence strongly favors the Big Bang event, which is now essentially universally accepted.[7] Detailed measurements of the expansion rate of the universe place the Big Bang singularity at an estimated 13.787±0.020 billion years ago, which is considered the age of the universe.
                
                There remain aspects of the observed universe that are not yet adequately explained by the Big Bang models. After its initial expansion, the universe cooled sufficiently to allow the formation of subatomic particles, and later atoms. The unequal abundances of matter and antimatter that allowed this to occur is an unexplained effect known as baryon asymmetry. These primordial elements—mostly hydrogen, with some helium and lithium—later coalesced through gravity, forming early stars and galaxies. Astronomers observe the gravitational effects of an unknown dark matter surrounding galaxies. Most of the gravitational potential in the universe seems to be in this form, and the Big Bang models and various observations indicate that this excess gravitational potential is not created by baryonic matter, such as normal atoms. Measurements of the redshifts of supernovae indicate that the expansion of the universe is accelerating, an observation attributed to an unexplained phenomenon known as dark energy.</p>

            <p style="padding-left:60; text-align: justify;text-align: justify; padding-right: 30px;">Aimed at explaining how organisms change, or evolve, over time date back to Anaximander of Miletus, a Greek philosopher who lived in the 500s B.C.E. Noting that human babies are born helpless, Anaximander speculated that humans must have descended from some other type of creature whose young could survive without any help. He concluded that those ancestors must be fish, since fish hatch from eggs and immediately begin living with no help from their parents. From this reasoning, he proposed that all life began in the sea.

                Anaximander was correct; humans can indeed trace our ancestry back to fish. His idea, however, was not a theory in the scientific meaning of the word, because it could not be subjected to testing that might support it or prove it wrong. In science, the word “theory” indicates a very high level of certainty. Scientists talk about evolution as a theory, for instance, just as they talk about Einstein’s explanation of gravity as a theory.
                
                A theory is an idea about how something in nature works that has gone through rigorous testing through observations and experiments designed to prove the idea right or wrong. When it comes to the evolution of life, various philosophers and scientists, including an eighteenth-century English doctor named Erasmus Darwin, proposed different aspects of what later would become evolutionary theory. But evolution did not reach the status of being a scientific theory until Darwin’s grandson, the more famous Charles Darwin, published his famous book On the Origin of Species. Darwin and a scientific contemporary of his, Alfred Russel Wallace, proposed that evolution occurs because of a phenomenon called natural selection.
                
                In the theory of natural selection, organisms produce more offspring than are able to survive in their environment. Those that are better physically equipped to survive, grow to maturity, and reproduce. Those that are lacking in such fitness, on the other hand, either do not reach an age when they can reproduce or produce fewer offspring than their counterparts. Natural selection is sometimes summed up as “survival of the fittest” because the “fittest” organisms—those most suited to their environment—are the ones that reproduce most successfully, and are most likely to pass on their traits to the next generation.
                
                This means that if an environment changes, the traits that enhance survival in that environment will also gradually change, or evolve. Natural selection was such a powerful idea in explaining the evolution of life that it became established as a scientific theory. Biologists have since observed numerous examples of natural selection influencing evolution. Today, it is known to be just one of several mechanisms by which life evolves. For example, a phenomenon known as genetic drift can also cause species to evolve. In genetic drift, some organisms—purely by chance—produce more offspring than would be expected. Those organisms are not necessarily the fittest of their species, but it is their genes that get passed on to the next generation.
